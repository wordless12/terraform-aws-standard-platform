# Complete Example

This example demonstrates a comprehensive setup of the entire AWS Standard Platform with all five layers (Organization, Base, Foundation, Project, and Workload) configured together using Terraform. **This example is designed ONLY for testing and validation purposes - it is NOT how the module should be used in production.**

## 🔧 What's Included

### Analysis of Terraform Configuration

#### Main Purpose
